# YOLOs-CPP Test Pipeline 🚀

This document describes the testing pipeline for evaluating inference results of object detection, classification, and segmentation models. The pipeline compares outputs from the Python Ultralytics framework against our C++ implementation.

## Supported Tasks

Currently, only object detection is supported:

- [x] Object Detection 🦾
- [x] Classification 🧠
- [x] Segmentation 🖼️
- [x] Pose Estimation 🎯
- [x] Oriented Bounding Boxes 📐

## Workflow

1. **Model Preparation** 🛠️  
    - Download pretrained models using Ultralytics.
    - Export models to ONNX format.

2. **Inference** 🤖  
    - Run inference using the C++ pipeline.
    - Extract results for each task into JSON files.

3. **Testing** 🧪  
    - Use googletest to compare C++ results with ground truth results generated by Ultralytics (Python).

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Confidence Error Margin (Detection only)**: 0.1  
- **Bounding Box Coordinates Error Margin** (Detection only): 50 pixels
- **Mask Error Margin (Segmentation only)**: 1%

## How to Run

- Use the `run_test.sh` script in the root folder to execute the entire pipeline:
  ```bash
  ./run_test.sh <task_type (0 for detection, 1 for classification, 2 for segmentation, 3 for pose, 4 for obb, 5 for all, default: 0)>
  ```

## Notes

- Ground truth results are pre-generated using the Ultralytics framework.
- Classification and segmentation tasks are not yet supported; support for these will be added in future updates.
- This pipeline is part of the YOLOs-CPP repository. 📦
